## My Emacs initialization
- I work in  mostly in `R`, `LaTex`, `Rmarkdown` and my emacs setup
  reflects this
- See `init.el` for my initialization (.emacs file)
- See the `snippits` folder for my custom snippits
- Most of my customizations are compiled from other people; in my
  `init.el` file I've tried to list links to the original sources


## Emacs packages
- See
[Vincent Goulet's page](https://vigou3.github.io/emacs-modified-windows/)
  for a general setup for ESS on windows with `Acutex` and `polymode`
- Other packages
  - auto-complete
  - rainbow-delimiters
  - yasnippet
  - key-chord
  - ahk-mode (for authotkey scripts)
  - zenburn-theme
  - material-theme

## Non-standard keybindings 

I use a few keybindings that deviate from the usual emacs (and
aforementioned packages) distribution:
- `yasnipit`s are fired using `C-tab`
- The R `<-` assignment operator is bound to `C-=`
- In R, `>>` converts to the pipe operator `%>%`
- In Rmarkdown, `C-c R` inserts an R code chunk
