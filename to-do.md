# Emacs Init to do 

* Comments are being used from ess mode `##` in Emacs-Lisp mode (should be `;;`) when typing `M-;` I think that this only happens when an R session is started 

* Company mode -- figure out how to not include in comments??
  - seems non-trivial 
  
* Maybe disable lower buffer with help, except when needed. 
  - see https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/1223
  - see https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/1223#issuecomment-586674535
  
* Make markdown code text bigger 
* Get spelling working right on work computer versus when using this computer -- possibly check if the variable `emacs-modified-version` exists 

* auto-fill mode
  
* On my work computer using emacs modified for windows, when I hit shift enter it sends the result to a new buffer even if a buffer is already open -- see if this is an issue on my dell and try to fix 


## Rmd mode 

* working now, but I would like to render the equations with auctex if possible 
* Ask emacs exe or reddit emacs 

$y=x_1$
