# Emacs Init to do 

* Comments are being used from ess mode `##` in Emacs-Lisp mode (should be `;;`) when typing `M-;` I think that this only happens when an R session is started 

* Company mode -- figure out how to not include in comments??
  - seems non-trivial 
  
* Maybe disable lower buffer with help, except when needed.
